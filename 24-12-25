# Messed around with a domain I brought. I didn't realise Godaddy so aggressively pushed AI at you these days, so I do regret going with them a little - I may just suck up the cost and pay for wordpress integration so I don't have to keep enabling/disabling things.

# Did some lessons with boot.dev. I am embarassed to admit how much copy pasting I did for the sake of gameification, so I'm going to redo the chapter.

# I did feel I clicked well with nested dictionaries though. It's like navigating filepaths. :)
