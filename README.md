# fiesta-front
The more front end focused sibling of cuddly-fiesta.


# resources

https://www.theodinproject.com/ 

https://scrimba.com/ 

Both are more "full stack" focused but I am mostly focusing on the frontend applications/lessons from these resources at present


# some goals

Redo a silly personal site

Stretch goal: no template!

Use said silly personal site to host some of my smaller projects that I referenced in #cuddly-fiesta
