# fixed mindset - if it doesn't work this way it won't work, you either know how to do something or don't
# growth mindset - learn from things that don't work. "I struggled with something and learned about it, so which my brain learning"
# "I liked that you struggled with the problem" isn't a bad thing, it's positive as it's showing you're TRYING to push through
#  it and make progress


brain working:
# focused - when you're actually paying attention to what you're doing and internalising it
# diffused - more subconscious, but you'll chew through things you did when focused without thinking
# about it too much and this sometimes can lead to solutions (shower thoughts...)


WHY ISN'T IT WORKING?
# Google, because someone probably had the same problem, asked about it and got a solutions
# Take a break and come back to it - revisit it when your brain has had chance to chill
# Ask for help! Show your working.


No deadlines:
# Not a structured class
# Adds additional stress for no reason
# Can be fun to set a self imposed goal, but there is plenty of time 



# Learning motivation: 
# Isn't solely a case of "learning quickly and easily"
# A very nebulously defined aspect to have is "grit" which is stamina is stick to a very long-term goal. Work ethic.
	# It's structured but you went to school for 4 years. So you can stick with out for 3 - 4 years as well. 
# As Gold Ship would say "horse girls need guts"
# It's important to stick it!

Don't ask people to download things! 

Read.me is a good place to throw known bugs/problems for your own reference while learning (this is standard practise for Github documentation)



# XY Problem - asking for X, thinking you need to do Y, implementing Y and then it not actually being relevant or useful for X at all

# 5 Things To Ask:
	# Provide a link to your project or lesson
	# Provide existing code (see above)
	# Explain the problem and what steps are needed to reproduce it
	# Describe what you're expecting to happen and why you're expecting this to happen from what you've coded
	# Summarize what's already been tried. This cuts out duplicate solutions and can also let people say "when you tried this did you do..."
