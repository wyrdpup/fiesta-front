# fixed mindset - if it doesn't work this way it won't work, you either know how to do something or don't
# growth mindset - learn from things that don't work. "I struggled with something and learned about it, so which my brain learning"
# "I liked that you struggled with the problem" isn't a bad thing, it's positive as it's showing you're TRYING to push through
#  it and make progress


brain working:
# focused - when you're actually paying attention to what you're doing and internalising it
# diffused - more subconscious, but you'll chew through things you did when focused without thinking
# about it too much and this sometimes can lead to solutions (shower thoughts...)


WHY ISN'T IT WORKING?
# Google, because someone probably had the same problem, asked about it and got a solutions
# Take a break and come back to it - revisit it when your brain has had chance to chill
# Ask for help! Show your working.


No deadlines:
# Not a structured class
# Adds additional stress for no reason
# Can be fun to set a self imposed goal, but there is plenty of time 



# Learning motivation: 
# Isn't solely a case of "learning quickly and easily"
# A very nebulously defined aspect to have is "grit" which is stamina is stick to a very long-term goal. Work ethic.
	# It's structured but you went to school for 4 years. So you can stick with out for 3 - 4 years as well. 
# As Gold Ship would say "horse girls need guts"
# It's important to stick it!

# XY Problem - asking for X, thinking you need to do Y, implementing Y and then it not actually being relevant or useful for X at all

# 5 Things To Ask:
	# Provide a link to your project or lesson
	# Provide existing code (see above)
	# Explain the problem and what steps are needed to reproduce it
	# Describe what you're expecting to happen and why you're expecting this to happen from what you've coded
	# Summarize what's already been tried. This cuts out duplicate solutions and can also let people say "when you tried this did you do..." 






### Odin Project Homework - Lesson "Computer Basics"

# Networks:

# Any form of linked computer

# As physically linking more than two can be very impractical, this is when you introduce a network switch ("switch") which solely takes messages from computers and sends them to their correct target destination
# e.g A -> Switch -> B, never reaches C

# Switches can be connected to other switches 
# e.g A -> Switch -> Switch -> F, never reaches anything else from A - J only F

# These can be infinitely chained together to make larger networks but this introduces more problems (e.g if a switch dies, then everything connected to it is cut off)

# This si why we use routers: they forward messages between local and wide area networks

# Modems are the physical object that connects routers to local networks and generally use the existing infrastructure from phone lines
# Note that some "modern" connections need upgrading/infrastructure replacement e.g conversion to fiber but the basic infrastructure for all internet network is phone lines

# Commercially avaialable routers are generally a switch/router/modem combination 

# Local network is then connected to another network (ISP) which is carried through to its destination 




##    What is a web server?
	
#	The computer that hosts a website 
	
#	So if the web server dies (or the computer hosting it), the site does as well unless it has an alternative host
	
#	Comparable to a library (holds books, which are different websites)
	
#	Not to be confused with "website is not responding" (is often the web server). "Web server is not responding" may be part of the host or all of it
	
##    What is a network?
	
#	Any form of linked computer (see above)
	
	
##    What is the internet?

#	A big ol wire. Sometimes satelitte (rural, plane)
	
##	Infrastructure that enables connection between networks that services such as web access and IRC use to connect
   
#	Clients: anything connected an ISP 
	
   
 ##  Within this these are different types of network - 
   
   # Extranet: has part or all of private network accessible, usually for business purposes or sharing information between collaborators
   # Intranet: fully private network, usually has some form of log in portal. Example are work related training sites, schedule management etc
   
   # These can be accessed from anywhere as long as the credentials are valid (some may have IP white/blacklisting)
 
	# Despite cloud servers, it still isn't cloud based 
   
  ##  What is an IP address?
	
	# Identifiers for a unique computer on a network represented as a series of numbers. "Postal address". EVERYTHING has one.
	
	# There's IP4 (the short 4 dot form) or IPv6 (the long ass one)
	
	# We use domain names for readability for websites (remember these are also computers - they're hosted on a server) 
	# These of course can be alphanumerical (www.mysite.com vs 192.0.2.188)
	
	
	
    ## What is a router?
	
	# Device that forwards messages between networks. Each time data passes throguh a router it adds "layers" (adds IP address) to the packet. This ensures that data goes where it needs to go 
	
	# Commercially available routers are a combination of modem/switch/router 
  

   ## What is an ISP?
   
   # Internet service provider
	# Will be the ones making the bulk of decision making about pathing for example
   
   ## What are packets and how are they used to transfer data?
	
	# Data broken down into smaller chunks when being moved between networks, which are then reassembled at their destination
	
	# Breaking down into small chunks helps avoid issues with dropped packets or corruption - it's easier to request missing packets than have to request the full data
	
	# Packets also can use network routing more efficient (e.g "send this down a less busy connection to the same destination")

	# If they arrive out of order it doesn't matter, as long as they can be reassembled 
	
	# Each packet involves:
	# - Header: has all the identifying details (server + client IP, packet number, total number of packets, details of protocols used in tranmission)
	# - Payload: the actual data
	
	# Packet loss is when this doesn't work as efficiently as it should - packets get dropped somewhere on their way across various routers 
	# Tends to happen with too much data being sent through a specific router, so the router loses data being sent to it
	# Too much of this in a network is frustrating to an end user and it becomes more obvious in things like voice calls, streaming, gaming because it results in latency 
	# Mitigated by sending packets through a different router if it's being blasted/is otherwise having technical issues 
	
    ## What is a client?
	
	# Client: typical end user (computer connected to wifi, web browser accessing a website). Literally any device that makes/sends requests and receives them from some form of server
	
	# Servers can sometimes be a client (revisit later)

	# Clients make a copy of whatever is available on a server on their own machine
	
    ## What is a server?
	
	# Server: computers that store webpages 
	
	## A really simple definition is just "it's a computer" and is primary job is listening to client requests 
	## e.g when you go to a website, the server sends you the information requested 
	
    ## What is a web page?
	
	# A document that can be displayed within a web browser 
	
	
    ## What is a web browser?
	
	
    ## What is a search engine?
	# Service that helps you find other webpages
	# Google, Duckduckgo, Bing etc
	
	# Some web browsers have imbedded search in the address bar
	
	# Helps find a specific website's unique location
	
	## What is a DNS request?
	
	# Domain name system (remember that domain names are just readable versions of IP addresses)
	
	# Every domain has an end dot (www.hithere.com.)
	
	# DNS requests:
	 # -> do I already know what the IP address of this domain name is (configured on computer, cached)
	 # -> OS queries DNS if it does not know
	 # -> COM: Is only really concerned with the root name server ("you want to go to the TLD")
	 # -> Then top level domain/TLD ("this is where www.hithere.com lives")
	 # -> Authorative name server ("www.hithere.com is at this IP address")
	 # -> This is all sent (and cached) to the client browser
	 
	 # If any of these vanish, the process breaks entirely
	
	
    ## Which browser are you currently using?
	
	Firefox 146.01


	
    ## In your own words, describe the process that takes place when you initiate a search on google.com in terms of what we discussed.

# Client requests all the DNS info for Google 

# Data sent and received rom appropriate server to display the HTML for Google

# User then can input whatever they're looking for, this data is also sent + received and displays appropriate result and 309857u42387 ads 

## Request - Response: 

# Request:
# Device -> asks for resoruce (HTML, token, image, whatever) - if not on the same client, will then need to connect to the internet

##Response: 
#Reply to request
#Server does as it's asked (in theory) and should just contain what was requested from the client
#May send "no auth" for example without login details and go "no >:("

#(200 = status OK)

##Request:
#"Can I also have this google hosted font"

##Response: 
#200 

##Request:
#"Can I have the CEO access"

##Response:
#"No" (403, "Forbidden")
